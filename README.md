# PROJECT MADS

**MADS** stands for **M**aster **A**lgorithms and **D**ata **S**tructures

## About

I enjoy solving problems or puzzles that require me to think harder about "*what*", "*why*" and "*how*", as doing so makes my daily life more interesting and inspiring as I am always excited about learning something new.  
This project covers my journey to master Algorithms and Data Structures using competitive programming problems and other challenging problems. It contains notes,explanation and my version of solutions to these problems from platforms like **LeetCode, CodeChef, CSES** etc. The solutions are written in **C/C++**. The solutions in the repo are free to use and learn from, with their corresponding names/problem codes of the same available on the respective platform.

## Tech

- [C](https://www.cprogramming.com/)
- [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14) - Written in C++ 14
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows) - A cross-platform IDE for C and C++

## How to use

1. Open the platform based directory of your choice 
2. Navigate through the sub directories and open the file with the same name/problem code as the problem of your choice.
